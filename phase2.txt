Overall, Matchy is a website for students to find their ideal teammates. 
The app is deployed here: https://matchy-app.herokuapp.com/ .To get 
started, please follow the instructions:

=============== Edits of Data and New Features ===================
Since one of our teammates dropped the course, we chose to delete the 
chat page and focus more on the search and invitation functionalities.

Users no longer need to update their status. Instead, they can create 
project groups, waiting for others to join. Users can also choose to 
search for other project groups and send a request to join at will. 

For a specific project, the users can "quit" the project or "finish" 
the project when the project is done. Upon finishing the project, the 
users can rate and comment their teammates, which will then be displayed 
on their teammates' profile pages.

=============== Role of Users ===================
The Matchy's potential users are students at university who want to 
find ideal teammates for their course assignments and projects, or 
simply study partners. 

All users have their own profile page, showing their skills, the 
courses they have taken, and also the comments from their past teammates.

One user can start his own projects or join existing projects and 
work with others. When the project is finished, users can rate their 
teammates and leave comments!

=============== Detailed Instructions ===================
Proceed as normal if everything looks good on your screen. Since 
everything is tested under the resolution 1920*1080, if anything is 
off during the testing, please adjust accordingly.

==Admin==
Matchy only has one admin user in the data base. Log in with 
email: admin, password:admin and you will go to the admin page. 
(a) User Credential allows the admin to change any user's email, 
password, rating, and year.
(b) Stats shows some important data of Matchy.
(c) Add Course allow the admin to add a new course to the database.

==Sign Up==
Click on sign up button and you can sign up as a regular user. 
Fill in the form with proper user email, name, password and year. 
If any field is invalid, a warning would show up. 
Please keep in mind that although we put some fake user data in 
the data base with password length less than 8 digits, we enforce 
that when signing up, the password length must be at least 8 digits.

==Log In==
Log in with the newly signed up account or the fake users. We have 
three fake users in the database, i.e. user:user, user1:user1, and
user2:user2. You will be redirected to the profile page. 
after you log in.

==Profile and Account Setting==
This profile page is very straight forward. You can add courses and
skills to the profile. Then, click the Settings button on the right of
nav bar and go to the account setting page, where you can reset 
the user name, password, user's profile picture and introduction.

==Projects==
Click the Projects on the navigation bar, which shows the current 
projects the user is working on. For each project, the user can choose
to finish or quit the project. The difference is that quit the project 
will just remove the user from the project, but finish a project will 
give the user a chance to give a review on the teammates. You can always 
choose to start your own project by clicking add project.

==Search for Projects==
Click the Find button on the navigation bar and start a new search. 
The search result will contain all projects that match the search conditions,
excluding the projects that the user are working on and all the finished projects. 
The user can see profiles of each user in the group, and send an application 
if he wants to join the group. The group creator will receive the 
application and decide whether to accept or reject the applicant.
(Applications are shown in the Invitation in the nav bar.)

If the user input ALL for sections, it will search for all projects in all sections
that satisfy the condition. The "project name" field is optional. All the other fields
are required.

=============== overview of the routes ===================
Express routes are in index.js. The file is commented properly 
so you can take a look at that. Basically we have many routes for 
different purposes. For example, we have app.get('/dashboard') to 
route the dashboard page, app.get('/users/logout') to destroy the 
session and log out the user, app.patch('/user/:email/:name/:year/:rating') 
to change a user's profile, app.put('/addCourse') to add a new course to 
the user's profile... Nearly all routes in the index.js are commented 
so please refer to that for detailed information.
